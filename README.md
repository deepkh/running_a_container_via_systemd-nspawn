# Running a file sytem via systemd-nspawn
This is a quick tutorial for those who want to know how to run a **systemd** and **dbus** inside a file sytem. This guide will demonstrate how to install file system of *Ubuntu-23.10-Mantic-amd64* via *systemd-nspawn*.

## The main difference between systemd-nspawn and Docker
At the moment, the *systemd-nspawn* could run **systemd** and **dbus** inside the file system in a regular way, but the Docker **can't**. It means the file system via *systemd-nspawn* could be treated as a real system. 

## Install systemd-nspawn on the host system
*user@host:/#* `sudo apt-get install systemd-container`

## Bootstrap a basic file system of *Ubuntu-23.10-mantic_amd64* to */var/lib/machines/Ubuntu-23.10-mantic-amd64*
This step probably requires the time of a cup of coffee to finish.

*user@host:/#* `sudo debootstrap --include=systemd,dbus --verbose --arch amd64 Ubuntu-23.10-mantic /var/lib/machines/Ubuntu-23.10-mantic http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu`

After the fetching and depacking processes are done, the *debootstrap* will provide a minimally bootable file system.

## Change the root password and add a default user before logging into the file system of *Ubuntu-23.10-mantic-amd64*
Because the fresh file system of *Ubuntu-23.10-mantic-amd64* doesn't have a password for root and also does not exist for the default user. Thus, we have to setup a password for root and create a default user for the file system of *Ubuntu-23.10-mantic-amd64*. 

### Use `mount` to mount the file system of *Ubuntu-23.10-mantic-amd64*

*user@host:/#*
```bash
  #!/bin/bash
  CONTAINER="/var/lib/machines/Ubuntu-23.10-mantic-amd64"
  sudo mount -t proc none $CONTAINER/proc 2> /dev/null
  sudo mount -t sysfs sys $CONTAINER/sys  2> /dev/null 

  sudo mount -o bind /dev $CONTAINER/dev 2> /dev/null
  sudo mount -o bind /dev/pts $CONTAINER/dev/pts 2> /dev/null
  sudo mount -o bind /dev/tty $CONTAINER/dev/tty 2> /dev/null

  sudo mount -o bind /opt $CONTAINER/opt 2> /dev/null
  sudo mount -o bind /home $CONTAINER/home 2> /dev/null
  sudo mount -o bind /root $CONTAINER/root 2> /dev/null
```

### Use *chroot* to switch to the file system of *Ubuntu-23.10-mantic-amd64*
*user@host:/#* ``sudo chroot /var/lib/machines/Ubuntu-23.10-mantic-amd64 /bin/bash``

There is a different prompt: *root@hpc:/#* shows in the terminal if chroot is successful. In the meantime, we could use the system tools in the file system of *Ubuntu-23.10-mantic-amd64* to setup the password for root and create a default user.

#### Give a password for root
Now you have been switched into the file system of *Ubuntu-23.10-mantic-amd64* via *chroot*. So here just enter the *passwd* to setup password for root.

*root@container:/#* ```passwd```

#### Create a default user and give him a password
And also create a default user via command of *useradd*.

*root@container:/#*
```bash
  #/bin/bash
  BOOTSTRAP_DEFAULT_USER=default_user_name
  useradd -m -d /home/${BOOTSTRAP_DEFAULT_USER} -s /bin/bash ${BOOTSTRAP_DEFAULT_USER}
  passwd ${BOOTSTRAP_DEFAULT_USER}
```

#### Quit chroot and unmount all associated devices
At the moment, the file system had a password for root and a default user. So we don't need to stay here for long. We leave the file system of *Ubuntu-23.10-mantic-amd64* via *quit* immediately.

*root@container:/#* ``quit``

Clear it up by unmount all associated devices. Please keep in mind that you should reboot the host computer if the umount is failed. *(The umount is often successful. But somehow, the devices can't umount successful because they are busy.)*.

*user@host:/#* 
```bash
  #/bin/bash
  CONTAINER="/var/lib/machines/Ubuntu-23.10-mantic-amd64"

  sudo mount -t proc none $CONTAINER/proc 2> /dev/null
  sudo mount -t sysfs sys $CONTAINER/sys  2> /dev/null 

  sudo mount -o bind /dev $CONTAINER/dev 2> /dev/null
  sudo mount -o bind /dev/pts $CONTAINER/dev/pts 2> /dev/null
  sudo mount -o bind /dev/tty $CONTAINER/dev/tty 2> /dev/null

  sudo mount -o bind /opt $CONTAINER/opt 2> /dev/null
  sudo mount -o bind /home $CONTAINER/home 2> /dev/null
  sudo mount -o bind /root $CONTAINER/root 2> /dev/null
```

## Boot up the container of *Ubuntu-23.10-mantic_amd64* via Host's *systemd*
There has been created a *root file system* and the *default user* we needed. So we just boot the container of `Ubuntu-23.10-mantic-amd64`Â up via *systemd-nspawn*. The *--bind /opt:/opt* is useful parameter for mapping devices between *host* and *container*.

*user@host:/#* ```sudo systemd-nspawn --boot --machine=Ubuntu-23.10-mantic-amd64 --bind /opt:/opt --private-users=off```

The following message will show up if it succeeds.

```bash
